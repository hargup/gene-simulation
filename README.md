gene-simulation
===============

This is a toy script I wrote in the Summer. I wanted to study how fast an allel
which causes autosomal recessive diseases die out of the gene pool. In the
process I discovered the process of
[genetic-drift](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift).

Later I wrote a cleaner script to simulate the marbles in a jar example given
on the wikipedia page.
